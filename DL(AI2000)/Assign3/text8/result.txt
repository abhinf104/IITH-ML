The x-axis of the graph will consist of ratio of cntp/cntc, i.e. the
ratio of the number of producer threads to the consumer threads. It will specifically
consist of the following 5 values: 10, 5, 1, 0.5, 0.1.
You can have μp = μc = 10, cntp = 100 in the above experiments.

Using parameters: capacity=100, np=10, nc=10, cntp=100, cntc=100, mu_p=8, mu_c=12
