- Comparison of different distance metrics
- MNIST digit classification

## Assignment 2: Regression

The [Regression assignment](Assign2_Regression.ipynb) explores:

- Understanding error surfaces
- Modeling relationship between height and weight
- Study of model order and overfitting
- Regularization techniques
